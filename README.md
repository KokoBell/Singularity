# Singularity

This is a small winforms tool that allows you to run scripts without having to open a console. It currently supports the following types of scripts:
* Batch (.bat)
* Python (.py)
* PowerShell (.ps1)

You may pass arguments by adding them after the filepath once you have selected a script to run.
